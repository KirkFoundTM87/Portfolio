# Portfolio
This is the data analytics portfolio of Kirk Jimenez.
I have completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate program offered through Coursera and am seeking to apply the knowledge gained from the program by doing various projects.
Contained in this portfolio are projects that showcase the skills learned throughout the certification process including visualizations created in R and Tableau, as well as data cleaning in SQL.
