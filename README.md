# Tech Portfolio/Home Server Project
This is the IT portfolio for Kirk Jimenez.
I have completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate program offered through Coursera and am seeking to apply the knowledge gained from the program by doing various projects.
Contained in this portfolio are projects that showcase the skills learned throughout the certification process including visualizations created in R and Tableau, as well as data cleaning in SQL. I will also use this README to document my experiments with setting up a home server.
